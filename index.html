			<p>Trixie and Katya arrive at the woods, they&rsquo;re vast and dark, they&rsquo;re one of the only parts of town that haven&rsquo;t been developed and it&rsquo;s a foreboding presence in front of them. Katya turns the car off, their surroundings becoming even more ominous without the illumination of the headlights. The air around them is still, the trees ahead looking like a scary movie set with the way they are completely still.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Katya grabs her backpack from the backseat where she kept it protected during the drive. She slams the door closed and slings it over her shoulder, noticing that Trixie is still sitting still in the front seat, not seeming to want to exit the safety of the car. She walks around to the passenger side of the car, and opens the front door, &ldquo;you ready babe?&rdquo; she asks, encouraging Trixie to leave the warmth of the vehicle.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Trixie looks at her, fear evident in her eyes, &ldquo;Katya, I&rsquo;m not so sure about this,&rdquo; her voice is wavering, and Katya kind of feels bad for dragging her out to do this.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; Katya whines, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hold your hand the whole time, I promise,&rdquo; she adds, softer, hoping it will tempt Trixie to leave the car.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pitch black out there, Kat,&rdquo; Trixie points out.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I brought,&rdquo; Katya reaches behind her blindly, feeling around for the flashlights she knows she packed in her bag, she eventually finds them, bringing them around to show Trixie triumphantly, &ldquo;these!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Trixie takes one with a shaky hand, inspecting it for a moment before turning it on, clearly checking to see if Katya remembered batteries. She still makes no move to exit the car, she&rsquo;s rolling the flashlight between her hands nervously, her eyes drifting off toward the trees, as if she&rsquo;s waiting for a sign that it&rsquo;s safe to venture in.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Katya waits patiently, but Trixie makes no moves to stand up. She sighs, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t have to do this, we can just go home,&rdquo; she suggests, not wanting to force her girlfriend to do something she so clearly doesn&rsquo;t want to do.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Trixie looks up at Katya, seeing the disappointment on her features and sucks in a deep breath, summons all of her courage, and schools her features, determined to go ghost hunting with her girlfriend, &ldquo;no, let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; she says decidedly.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Katya smiles brightly, but Trixie still makes no move to exit the car. Katya reaches her hand out to her, and Trixie takes it, holding it tightly as she finally stands up and closes the car door. Katya kisses her softly when she turns back around, smiling comfortingly at the taller woman and they stand there for a second, Katya vibrating in anticipation and Trixie trying to focus on not being terrified.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Katya makes the first move, pulling Trixie along through the small dirt parking lot at the edge of the tree line. They approach the trees, there&rsquo;s an entrance where the trail that runs through the forest is, a path that they&rsquo;ve walked together many times.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Katya stops them at the beginning of the path, listening to the way Trixie&rsquo;s breathing is faster than normal, giving her hand an encouraging squeeze. &ldquo;Should we follow the path, or find our own way,&rdquo; she asks.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Trixie looks around, flashing her flashlight all around them to try to find the direction that seems the least intimidating. &ldquo;Both options sound awful,&rdquo; she finally responds after she determines that they are surrounded by absolutely nothing but miles and miles of crushing darkness.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

	<!-- 	<p><em>&lt;i&gt;If you choose to follow the path, go to chapter 2&nbsp;</em></p>

					<p id="shh">ch2</p>

			<p>They decide to follow the path, walking down it hand in hand. It gets colder the further they go into the woods, and Trixie is grateful for the walking furnace her hand is attached to. As they walk down the path, Trixie keeps her flashlight moving at a constant pace around them, making sure to look in every direction so that nothing sneaks up on them. The grip she has on Katya&rsquo;s hand is crushing and Katya is starting to lose feeling on her fingers, but she doesn&rsquo;t complain.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Trixie jumps at every little noise they hear and Katya reassures her every time that they&rsquo;re okay, whispering comfortingly to her. They walk for a while, Katya stopping them every once and a while to stand still for a few minutes to, &ldquo;let the ghosts catch up.&rdquo; Trixie giggles at that a little, Katya&rsquo;s fascination with ghosts is adorable, despite the fact that it drags Trixie into the middle of the woods on Halloween night.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>After about fifteen minutes of walking along the path that Trixie doesn&rsquo;t remember ever being quite this long, something starts to change. At first, they don&rsquo;t really notice it, continuing to walk, but the more they walk the more apparent it becomes that the air around them has grown foggy. It&rsquo;s becoming harder to see ahead of them, Trixie&rsquo;s flashlight isn&rsquo;t allowing her to see very deep into the woods anymore, and it&rsquo;s making her panic.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Katya what&rsquo;s happening,&rdquo; her voice wavers as she says it, her heart rate spiking so Katya can feel it in her wrist that&rsquo;s pressed tightly to hers.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, baby it&rsquo;s just some fog,&rdquo; she tries to sound reassuring, but her voice breaks slightly in fear.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see where we&rsquo;re going,&rdquo; Trixie panics, not liking that she can&rsquo;t be sure that they aren&rsquo;t being followed, she can&rsquo;t help but feel paranoid.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Come on, we have to keep walking,&rdquo; Katya says, pulling her hand to get her to walk again, they need to continue on the path to make it out of the fog or the woods.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>They continue walking, Trixie&rsquo;s footsteps are both hesitant and urgent, eager to get out of the fog so she can see again, but scared to continue down the path when she can&rsquo;t see it.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Katya stops moving again, Trixie bumping into her from behind, &ldquo;why&rsquo;d you stop,&rdquo; she hisses, nudging Katya to walk again so they can get the hell out of the woods.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Trix look,&rdquo; she says, tugging on her arm to get her to see whatever she&rsquo;s looking at.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Trixie looks over Katya&rsquo;s shoulder, holding her flashlight out to get a better look, she has to squint her eyes to see through the fog, but she realizes that Katya stopped because the path separates into two directions. Trixie tries to think back to the other times they&rsquo;ve been on the path, not remembering there being more than one way to go. She tries not to let herself think too much about it so she doesn&rsquo;t get any more scared than she already is.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Which way do we go,&rdquo; Katya asks, Trixie envies how even her voice is, how calm she&rsquo;s managing to stay when Trixie is sure she&rsquo;s never been more scared in her life.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Trixie is about to answer when she hears a noise from deep in the woods. This is definitely the most scared she&rsquo;s ever been in her life. The noise is an odd sort of ringing, it echoes through the trees, and it sounds both far away and nearby, it&rsquo;s unlike anything either of them has ever heard before. Trixie is trembling now, Katya squeezing her hand and stepping closer so their bodies are touching, trying to calm her terrified girlfriend down a little.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; Trixie whimpers.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Katya whispers back, &ldquo;should we go see?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Trixie looks at her as if she&rsquo;s gone crazy, maybe she has, but pauses to think. The noise might be another person who could give them directions out of the woods that she thinks they might be lost in, but it could also be another person that wants to hurt them.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><br /><br /></p>

			<p>&ldquo;Come on, let's go this way,&rdquo; Katya says, veering off to the left, cutting through the trees.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>It&rsquo;s darker here than it was on the path, at least there the sky was partially exposed along the walkway. They&rsquo;re barely a hundred feet from the path, but Trixie can&rsquo;t even see it when she turns around. The details of the woods are completely swallowed by darkness, the moon blocked from view.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The flashlights only marginally help and Trixie refuses to look anywhere but where the light beam is illuminating after the third time she sees a menacing face staring at her in the darkness.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Katya I don&rsquo;t like this,&rdquo; Trixie says, voice shaking against her will.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, I got you,&rdquo; Katya says, stepping closer to Trixie so their arms brush against each other as they walk.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing here except bugs and probably bears,&rdquo; Trixie complains.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Katya&rsquo;s in the middle of responding, trying to crack a joke to loosen the tension and make Trixie less scared when she stops speaking, stopping in her tracks entirely.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Babe, look,&rdquo; Katya says in awe pointing to a spot ahead of them.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Trixie turns to look, seeing a glowing light coming from deep in the woods. It has a bluish hue to it, clearly not coming from either of their flashlights, and she feels the hair on her arms sticking up.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; Trixie asks, dumbfounded.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; Katya says. She sounds way too excited to see an unknown glow coming from the woods that they are currently, more or less, trapped in.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sound so excited,&rdquo; Trixie says pointedly, &ldquo;it could be dangerous.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;What if it&rsquo;s a ghost!&rdquo; Katya exclaims, bouncing on her heels at the thought, &ldquo;can we go see? Please?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Trixie says, hating the way it makes Katya deflate, but she&rsquo;s the cautious one, the one keeping them safe. Relatively.&nbsp;</p>

				<p id="shh">ch4</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s follow the noise, maybe whoever it is can help us,&rdquo; Trixie decides, more willing to go after hope than to wander off back into unknown territory.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Katya nods, squeezing Trixie&rsquo;s hand again and planting another soft kiss on her cheek before she starts pulling her off in the direction they heard the noise in. They walk down the path aimlessly, trying to stay quiet to hear any more noises that might occur. The fog gradually starts to lift around them and they can see a little better now, and a wave of relief washes over Trixie.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>They continue walking, going deeper and deeper and Trixie starts to grow nervous again, they&rsquo;re venturing into unfamiliar parts of the woods, and she&rsquo;s lost track of what direction they came from, and they haven&rsquo;t heard another noise since the first one. Her heart rate goes up again and just when she thinks they&rsquo;re definitely lost, the noise starts again. The mysterious ringing sounds closer this time, though they can&rsquo;t tell how they know that it sounds like it&rsquo;s coming from everywhere.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>They keep walking, the noise is more frequent now, and they assume they&rsquo;re going in the right direction. The noise eventually cuts off and Trixie worries that their hope is lost. Then, there&rsquo;s a soft glow emanating from the trees up ahead of them.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>They make eye contact briefly, asking with their eyes if they should see what the glowing is. They seem to decide that they should see what it is, moving ahead with certainty but also caution. Trixie&rsquo;s death grip on Katya&rsquo;s hand still hasn&rsquo;t let up and Katya fears that she might end this night with a broken finger or two.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>They walk slowly forward, careful with their steps in case whatever lies ahead is something that shouldn&rsquo;t be alerted of their presence. Trixie tries to calm her breathing down, holding her breath the closer they get to the strange lights.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>They make it closer to the lights, hiding behind a tree and poking their heads around to look at what is causing the glow. About ten feet ahead of them is a large ball of blue light, hovering above the ground and gently floating as if it&rsquo;s riding the waves of the ocean. It doesn&rsquo;t seem dangerous or threatening, though it is definitely strange.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>They turn to face each other again, Trixie with a look of utter confusion and Katya with one of pure delight and excitement. &ldquo;What is that,&rdquo; Trixie asks, hoping Katya has a better understanding of what is going on than her.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Trixie,&rdquo; she says back, bouncing up and down in her excitement, &ldquo;Trixie,&rdquo; she says again unhelpfully.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;What, what is it Kat,&rdquo; Trixie is slightly exasperated, though she is slightly calmer seeing that Katya isn&rsquo;t scared.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a will-o-the-wisp,&rdquo; Katya says, her voice rising in volume.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;A will-o-what?&rdquo; Trixie questions.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;A will-o-the-wisp,&rdquo; Katya repeats back.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I heard you, what the fuck is that?&rdquo; Trixie snaps back, losing her patience.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re ghost lights, they&rsquo;re supposed to lead you to something,&rdquo; Katya explains.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;What do they lead you to?&rdquo; Trixie asks, needing to be sure they&rsquo;re not going to follow something dangerous.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It could be anything,&rdquo; she answers back, not giving Trixie much hope that this is a good idea, &ldquo;I think we should follow them.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Trixie thinks it over, unsure about whether or not this is a good idea, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure, Kat.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; Katya whines, &ldquo;we found something supernatural, we can&rsquo;t give up now!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Trixie sighs, she doesn&rsquo;t want to disappoint the clearly excited blonde beside her, but she also doesn&rsquo;t want to put them in any kind of dangerous or questionable situation.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><br /><br /></p>

			<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we should, Kat,&rdquo; Trixie says. She doesn&rsquo;t want to disappoint her but this does not feel like a smart idea. The light looks too unnatural and she is not about to die because she willingly walked toward an unnatural light in the woods.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Katya says, she&rsquo;s slightly disappointed, but she gets to keep exploring now and that&rsquo;s just as much fun.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>She tugs Trixie&rsquo;s arm again, leading them away from the light and deeper into the dark woods. Trixie is starting to regret her decision, at least if they would have gone toward the light she would&rsquo;ve been able to see better.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>They walk for some time, the light behind them now, drowned out by the sea of trees around them and long forgotten.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Katya is having a great time, trotting along and looking around curiously, no care or fear in the world. Trixie on the other hand is still on edge, only turning to look when she hears a noise and has to whip her flashlight around to make sure it&rsquo;s not an axe murderer. She regrets being a horror fan for the first time for how paranoid it has her.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Look, Trixie!&rdquo; Katya says again, once more bouncing on her heels.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>It&rsquo;s so similar to how she reacted earlier that when Trixie looks up and sees another light in front of them she questions if they&rsquo;re stuck in a very short time loop.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This again,&rdquo; she says, almost under her breath but loud enough for Katya to hear and snort at.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Come on, it&rsquo;s a sign we have to find out what it is,&rdquo; she says.</p>
			<p>They walk slightly closer and Trixie notices that this light is different from the last one. It&rsquo;s not as steady, it flickers slightly and it isn&rsquo;t the same cold, blue tone as the other light they saw, this one is warmer, a glow rather than illumination.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I still don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a good idea,&rdquo; Trixie says.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Come on, we ignored the first one but this time it&rsquo;s too big of a coincidence we need to explore,&rdquo; Katya whines.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- 		<p><em>&lt;i&gt;If you choose to walk toward the warm glow, go to chapter 22&nbsp;</em></p>

		</div>

		<div id="ch6" style="display:none;">
			<p>Trixie sighs, hoping she isn&rsquo;t making the wrong decision for the millionth time that night, &ldquo;let's follow them.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Katya jumps up and down, leaving a sloppy kiss on Trixie&rsquo;s cheek in her excitement, &ldquo;thank you!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Trixie tugs on her hand gently to get her to calm back down, kissing her softly, trying to absorb some of the confidence and calm that Katya has in this situation.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Katya starts walking toward the glowing orb, and Trixie grows worried again, not sure that it&rsquo;s a good idea to follow a mysterious blue glowing orb through the woods that aren&rsquo;t familiar in the way they should be. As they get closer to the floating light, Trixie can feel an odd heat warm her face as if the thing is radiating warm energy. Before they are within touching distance of the apparition, it moves with an odd movement. It zips through the woods, further in the distance but in a place they can still see it, yet they can see a faint glowing trail left behind it, illuminating the path they&rsquo;re meant to take.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>They follow behind the glowing orbs for what feels like forever, going deeper and deeper into the woods, their surroundings becoming even more unfamiliar. Anticipation is building the further they walk, both anxious to see what they are being led toward.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>It&rsquo;s almost as if they can feel it when they arrive at their destination, it feels like they are in a place that&rsquo;s safe, familiar, even though they are sure they have never been here before.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; Katya whispers, echoing Trixie&rsquo;s thoughts.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Right after she says it, the wisp glows brighter than before, growing slightly in size before it disappears with a flash, leaving a ringing in its wake. Suddenly, it&rsquo;s dark again, leaving their eyes struggling to adjust to the sudden darkness. Trixie hadn&rsquo;t even realized that she&rsquo;d turned her flashlight off as they followed the path set out for them, and she turns it back on, trying to figure out where they were led.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; she asks, hoping Katya can make sense of where they are.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Katya is looking around too, inspecting their surroundings, until the beam of her flashlight falls upon something gray and stone. It wouldn&rsquo;t seem odd to her, but the shape of it is strange for a reason she can&rsquo;t place. She walks over to it, at some point her and Trixie&rsquo;s hands had let go, both of them feeling safe following the will-o-the-wisp trail. She leaves Trixie behind as she goes to inspect the stone, and when she makes her way to it, she has to clear the leaves and debris that are surrounding it, making it hard to see in its entirety.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>She cleans it off, pointing her flashlight to it and she realizes that it&rsquo;s a headstone.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Trixie,&rdquo; she calls out to her girlfriend, &ldquo;come look at this.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Trixie walks over, there&rsquo;s less caution in her steps than before, and stands next to Katya, looking down at the headstone, &ldquo;are we in a graveyard?&rdquo; she asks.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; Katya responds, &ldquo;it looks like this is the only grave.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Trixie looks around, trying to find another headstone to make sense of this, but Katya is right, this is the only headstone in the surrounding area. Trixie takes Katya&rsquo;s hand again, feeling uneasy again.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Why did it lead us here?&rdquo; Trixie asks, fear slipping into her voice again.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Katya whispers, trying to read the inscription on the stone, but it&rsquo;s not in English or any other language that she knows. Despite the oddness of this entire situation, Katya doesn&rsquo;t feel scared, she feels at ease here.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;What are we supposed to do?&rdquo; Trixie continues her line of questioning.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;re just supposed to wait and see what happens?&rdquo; Katya suggests, unsure of herself.</p>
			<p>Trixie shrugs, she doesn&rsquo;t have any better ideas, though she isn&rsquo;t entirely comfortable standing around in the middle of these woods by a gravesite.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Katya exclaims, &ldquo;I also brought a ouija board, we could try contacting whoever this is?&rdquo; she suggests.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;You brought a ouija board?&rdquo; Trixie asks incredulously.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Of course I did,&rdquo; Katya sounds mildly offended, &ldquo;what kind of ghost hunter doesn&rsquo;t bring a ouija board with them?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Of course, my bad,&rdquo; Trixie deadpans.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Well, what should we do?&rdquo; Katya asks.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><br /><br /><br /></p>
<!-- <p><em>&lt;i&gt;If you think they should wait and see what happens, go to chapter 8</em></p>

		<div id="ch7" style="display:none;">
			<p>They choose not to explore further, Trixie has a bad feeling and she trusts her instincts, she doesn&rsquo;t trust this situation. She&rsquo;d rather play it safe, especially because she&rsquo;s not convinced it wasn&rsquo;t a trap by someone that wants to hurt them.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>They walk away and hear a <em>puff</em> behind them, as if something has simply vanished in thin air. Trixie doesn&rsquo;t look back&nbsp;</p>
			<p>They continue their walk in the woods, not giving up on the original goal of finding a ghost.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>They walk and walk, getting deeper and deeper into the woods until their legs are aching with exhaustion, but they find nothing.&nbsp;</p>
			<br>
		<p><em>You didn&rsquo;t find a ghost, or really much of anything, the end.&nbsp;</em></p>

		<div id="ch8" style="display:none;">
			<p>They wait, and wait, and wait, and eventually, they sit down on the damp ground. As they continue to wait, Trixie gets more and more impatient, willing anything to happen, even something insignificant, just so they can leave. She feels fatigue washing over her from the combination of walking for what feels like hours, fear, and adrenaline, and her body starts to slouch, leaning up against Katya who is waiting patiently, at attention.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Just when she rests her head on Katya&rsquo;s shoulder and her eyes start to flutter closed in her exhaustion, she feels Katya perk up underneath her. Katya grabs her arm, &ldquo;Trixie,&rdquo; she whispers loudly, &ldquo;Trixie wake up,&rdquo; she whispers, shaking Trixie to get her to pay attention to whatever has caught her attention.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Trixie lifts her head from the warmth of her girlfriend&rsquo;s neck, rubbing at her tired eyes and trying to get them to focus back on the world around them, &ldquo;what is it?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>A gust of wind sweeps through the forest with a surprising force, making them both shiver before it settles back down, shifting into a more gentle breeze.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Trixie&rsquo;s eyes are finally working again and she follows Katya&rsquo;s gaze, her eyes landing on what appears to be a human-like figure glowing a dull silvery gray. Her eyes widen at the sight, her jaw going slack as she stares at what can&rsquo;t be anything other than a ghost. Katya&rsquo;s grip on her arm gets tighter as they both stare at the ghost, its back turned to them so they aren&rsquo;t yet seen.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Is that,&rdquo; Trixie trails off, not sure if she wants to make what she&rsquo;s seeing real by saying it out loud.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a ghost!&rdquo; Katya exclaims, shaking Trixie&rsquo;s arm now, &ldquo;we found a ghost! They&rsquo;re real!&rdquo; her voice is getting louder and Trixie shushes her, doesn&rsquo;t want to gain the attention of the ghost in case it&rsquo;s dangerous.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Trixie we found a ghost!&rdquo; she whisper-screams again, unable to contain herself.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Apparently,&rdquo; Trixie responds, sounding unsure. A part of her wonders if she actually did fall asleep on Katya&rsquo;s shoulder and she&rsquo;s just dreaming, but something tells her that she&rsquo;s awake, it all feels too real to be a dream.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;What should we do?&rdquo; Katya whispers.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Trixie whispers back, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re the ghost expert, you tell me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Do you think we should go try to talk to it?&rdquo; Katya asks, &ldquo;or just wait and see what it does?&rdquo; Trixie doesn&rsquo;t know if she&rsquo;s asking her or just thinking out loud and gives her a minute to figure it out.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s use the ouija board,&rdquo; Trixie decides. As much as she loathes the idea, she would feel better having something to do rather than just standing here.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Excellent choice,&rdquo; Katya responds with a grin as she lets her backpack sink to the ground below her.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Katya rifles through her bag for a second before pulling out the ouija board and she unzips the front pocket to grab the planchette. She sets both down on the ground, careful not to put it on top of any specific grave, and sits down on the ground, patting the empty space beside her for Trixie to sit too.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Trixie sits reluctantly, a chill going up her spine when she hits the cold ground. She has her back to the woods behind her and it&rsquo;s an eerie feeling, she can&rsquo;t shake the feeling that there&rsquo;s something in there, lurking behind her.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Katya says, placing the planchette on the board delicately, &ldquo;your fingers please.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what she said,&rdquo; Trixie responds, moving her fingers onto the planchette anyway.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This is a serious matter, Tracy, this is no time for jokes.&rdquo; Katya responds, humor in her voice despite the words.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Trixie responds, not sorry at all.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Katya places her fingers on the planchette across from Trixie&rsquo;s, looking up at her, &ldquo;ready?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Trixie nods, her stomach feels like it&rsquo;s in a loose knot, she doesn&rsquo;t believe in ouija boards but there&rsquo;s something about doing it in a graveyard that has her spooked.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Katya starts moving the piece in figure eights around the board, making sure they&rsquo;re holding it loosely enough for the planchette to move, and then she speaks, &ldquo;is there anyone here that wants to talk to us?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>They both fall silent, sitting still, staring at their hands waiting for something to happen. They wait for a couple of minutes, and just when they think nothing is going to happen, their fingers start moving.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Trixie look!&rdquo; Katya whispers excitedly.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The planchette moves somewhat slowly, drifting across the board and landing firmly over <em>yes.</em></p>
			<p>&ldquo;Did you do that?&rdquo; Trixie whispers, it sounds like something Katya would do.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Katya defends quickly, &ldquo;I swear I wouldn&rsquo;t do something like that, you know how serious I am about ghosts.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>She makes a good point, but Trixie still isn&rsquo;t sure she trusts her. There&rsquo;s no way a ghost is communicating to them through this children&rsquo;s game.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Are you a demon?&rdquo; Katya questions into the open air.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Why would they say yes if they are,&rdquo; Trixie questions.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lie,&rdquo; Katya yells to the air.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The planchette starts moving again, still pretty slowly. It moves across the board, landing on <em>no</em> this time.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Katya smiles up at Trixie and she rolls her eyes.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo; Katya asks this time.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The piece moves once again and it seems to be moving slightly faster, as if the ghost is gaining confidence. It moves over the 1 first, stopping briefly before moving to the 3.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;13,&rdquo; Katya whispers, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s so young.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>They&rsquo;re quiet for a moment, taking in the information before speaking again. They ask a few more questions, Trixie joining in shortly after when she starts feeling more comfortable. They learn that the ghost is named Russell and basic facts about his life.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;How did you die?&rdquo; Katya asks.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Katya! You can&rsquo;t just ask a kid that,&rdquo; Trixie scolds her.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Katya says, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to answer that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Their hands are still suddenly, no longer moving consistently around the board.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Are you still there?&rdquo; Katya questions after a couple minutes of silence.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The planchette moves back to the <em>yes</em> and Katya exhales in a sigh of relief. The piece starts moving again, to letters, spelling out L-I-O-N.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Lion?&rdquo; Katya questions out loud, &ldquo;you got killed by a <em>lion?</em>&lt;/i&gt; her jaw falls open slightly in shock. This kid is cooler than she will ever be.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The planchette moves again, slowly again, and lands on <em>no.</em></p>
			<p>&ldquo;You motherfucker,&rdquo; Katya says as Trixie cackles loudly.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>They spend hours talking to Russell, learning all about his life, his interests, his family. Just when the sun starts rising, Russell moves the planchette again, hesitating before moving to <em>goodbye.</em>Trixie feels a pang in her heart thinking about Russell, only 13, alone in these woods. She feels guilty having to leave him behind, likely never to talk to him again. She wonders if any of his family members are still out there, he spoke to them as though he died recently, she wonders if she could tell someone that she found him and he&rsquo;s okay.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Katya looks like she&rsquo;s feeling similar, sadness in her eyes as she swallows thickly, &ldquo;bye Russell,&rdquo; she whispers and the planchette goes still.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>They take their hands off the board, looking at each other, not knowing what to say. In a while they&rsquo;ll get up, heading back through the woods in silence to the car and drive home. The morning will bring a normal day, and Russell will be pushed to the back of their minds, never gone completely, a constant presence over their lives, a living memory to keep him alive.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>&ldquo;I think we should go try to talk to it,&rdquo; Katya finally decides.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Trixie looks over at her. Katya still seems unsure, for the first time since they got here showing uncertainty. Katya makes no moves to get up, so Trixie rises, pulls Katya&rsquo;s hand up with her to get her to stand too. &ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; Trixie decides, taking on the role of the courageous one now.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Katya nods her head, following Trixie&rsquo;s lead and they make their way slowly over to where the ghost is floating. As they get closer, it seems as though the ghost is looking for something, floating around slowly and turning its head to look around.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Before they manage to reach the ghost to talk to it, a stick breaks beneath one of their feet, a loud snapping noise sounding out, disturbing the complete silence of the woods that hung around them until that moment. They both freeze, not sure what to make of what just happened, and watch as the ghost whips around to face them, unhinging its jaw at an alarming speed and letting out an ear-piercing noise that Trixie thinks is a scream.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>They both stand frozen on their spots, not sure what to do. The ghost remains in front of them, its mouth open wider than a human&rsquo;s mouth could be, and bellowing a scream from deep within it, the sound is awful and gut-wrenching, and neither one knows what to do.&nbsp;</p>

	<div id="ch11" style="display:none;">
		<p>They decide to watch the ghost, observing the way it seems to be floating aimlessly but with some sort of intent. Katya&rsquo;s mouth is hanging open, her eyes shining with wonder as she watches a real-life ghost, just like she always wanted.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>They stand together, at a distance away from the ghost in order to be able to watch it quietly. They manage to go unnoticed for quite a few minutes, not learning much about the ghost other than it is clearly looking for something. The ghost is slowly making its way around the area, turning in circles, and then suddenly it&rsquo;s facing them, its eyes meeting their figures and time feels like it slows down in the few seconds it takes for the ghost to unhinge its ghost jaw and let out a deep scream, unlike anything they had ever heard. It&rsquo;s ear piercing in both volume and tone and it sounds somehow so human in its emotion but so inhuman in its sound.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Their hands are up, covering their ears before they even realize they&rsquo;re doing it, and though it doesn&rsquo;t help much in making things quieter, it does stop the way it feels like it&rsquo;s entering their ears, coursing through their bodies.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>They make eye contact, locking eyes and trying to communicate silently and Katya is glad to see that Trixie isn&rsquo;t panicking as much as she thought she would be. They wait there for what feels like hours, covering their ears and trying to drown out the noise that is seeping into their skin.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Eventually, the ghost stops screaming. When they deem it safe, they both slowly remove the hands from their ears. Katya takes Trixie&rsquo;s hand back in hers, asking if she&rsquo;s alright as quietly as she can and Trixie nods, not willing to speak and cause the ghost to scream again.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The ghost is staring at them now, looking unsure and Trixie almost laughs at how the ghost seems more scared of them than she is of it.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Um, hi,&rdquo; Katya speaks loud enough for the ghost to hear, testing the waters.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The ghost&rsquo;s eyes widen and it floats a little closer to them.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; it responds, and its voice is different than Trixie expected, it&rsquo;s not scary, it sounds human but with a weird metal quality to it, like the voice is being filtered through a metal tube.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The ghost is still staring at them, and they&rsquo;re both staring right back, at a stalemate with how to continue.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; the ghost breaks the silence.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Now that it&rsquo;s not screaming at them anymore, Trixie is able to get a much better look. She realizes that it&rsquo;s not an it it&rsquo;s a she, at least she thinks she is with the long hair that&rsquo;s tied in a braid that&rsquo;s semi apparent through her translucent body, and the flowing gown that&rsquo;s billowing around her.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Katya,&rdquo; Katya introduces herself with her usual relentless enthusiasm, &ldquo;and this is Trixie,&rdquo; she motions to Trixie with the hand that isn&rsquo;t holding Trixie&rsquo;s own.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I yelled,&rdquo; the ghost says quietly, she looks like she shrinks in size too.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; Katya says, not completely sure how to go about comforting a ghost, &ldquo;are you alright?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The ghost looks up at that, stares straight through Katya and it makes Trixie recoil.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared,&rdquo; the ghost practically hisses out.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>The ghost continues to shriek, not giving any indication of letting up soon. They stand there and wait, covering their ears, but the noise is so loud, so intense, that even with their ears covered, it&rsquo;s loud and clear. They can feel it in their bodies, sitting like rocks at the pits of their stomachs and vibrating through their bones, it&rsquo;s a weird sensation that travels through them like it&rsquo;s seeping through their skin.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya catches Trixie&rsquo;s eyes, trying to provide some kind of comfort with her gaze. Trixie appreciates the gesture, is glad that she has someone with her through this, that she isn&rsquo;t experiencing this alone.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>After what feels like forever, the screaming stops, and they&rsquo;re left in silence again. They both slowly remove their hands from their ears, testing the waters and hoping the ghost won&rsquo;t start screaming again.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The ghost is staring at them now, looking unsure and Trixie almost laughs at how the ghost seems more scared of them than she is of it.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Katya screams, her voice somehow loud enough to be heard over the wails coming from the ghost. The ghost continues its screaming despite Katya&rsquo;s command.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;STOP!&rdquo; Katya yells again, even louder this time.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The ghost stops yelling, its eyes piercing through Katya&rsquo;s frame. It seems to grow in size, it&rsquo;s body even more imposing and it changes to a bright red color: it&rsquo;s the embodiment of anger. Trixie swallows thickly, takes a step closer to Katya, and tries to calm the panic rising up to her throat.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The ghost inches closer to them and Trixie squeezes her eyes shut, too scared to keep them open and see what is about to happen.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Her eyes are still closed when she feels a puff of air wash over her body. She keeps her eyes screwed shut and feels her breathing growing more and more erratic.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Trixie open your eyes,&rdquo; Katya whispers, Trixie can feel her breath close to her face.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie shakes her head, not willing to open her eyes at all.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Come on, you can open them, it&rsquo;s okay baby,&rdquo; Katya whispers again, and Trixie calms down slightly at the tone she&rsquo;s using.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>She pries one eye open, keeping it squinted just in case she needs to snap them closed again quickly. She looks around and doesn&rsquo;t see the ghost anywhere, all she sees is Katya looking at her with worried eyes. She pulls her other eye open, moves her head around to make sure the ghost is actually gone, and when she&rsquo;s sure that it is she lets her body fall into Katya&rsquo;s. She feels slender arms wrapping around her shaking body and hold her tight, Katya&rsquo;s hand rubbing up and down Trixie&rsquo;s back comfortingly.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, it&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; Katya is reassuring her over and over.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie finally calms down enough to be able to move away from Katya&rsquo;s embrace, look at her face again, &ldquo;where did it go?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Katya shrugs, &ldquo;it got angry and then it just sort of...blew away.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie nods her head, not sure she&rsquo;s absorbing the information, but relieved that the ghost isn&rsquo;t around anymore, that they&rsquo;re safe. &ldquo;What do we do now?&rdquo; she asks.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;What do you want to do? Are you okay? Do you want to go home?&rdquo; Katya asks in response, her hands are still on Trixie&rsquo;s arms as if she thinks Trixie will collapse if she isn&rsquo;t being supported.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay,&rdquo; Trixie responds despite not really feeling okay at all, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you want to look for the ghost?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We already saw it, that&rsquo;s enough for me,&rdquo; Katya replies, and Trixie can tell that it&rsquo;s only a half-truth, that she wants to keep ghost hunting and that she&rsquo;s only saying that so Trixie won&rsquo;t feel guilty if she wants them to go home, it&rsquo;s so sweet and so Katya and it makes her heart clench.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay if you want to keep going,&rdquo; Trixie tells her, she doesn&rsquo;t want Katya to give up when she&rsquo;s so close to achieving her dream.</p>

		<p>&nbsp;They take off running, trying to escape the awful noise being emitted from the ghost they&rsquo;re leaving behind. The ghost doesn&rsquo;t appear to be following them, but the noise doesn&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s getting any quieter despite the amount of distance between them and the ghost increasing.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Eventually, the screaming ceases. They keep running a while longer, both of them out of breath and exhausted. They start to slow down, checking behind them periodically to make sure they aren&rsquo;t being chased. When the screaming has stopped for a while and they are certain they are safe, they stop running, taking a moment to catch their breath.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; Katya asks between her panting, looking at Trixie intently.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; Trixie responds, heaving, &ldquo;what just happened?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Katya responds, &ldquo;I think we scared it?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Katya shrugs, &ldquo;maybe it didn&rsquo;t know it was a ghost.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie isn&rsquo;t convinced but lets it drop. She hopes Katya isn&rsquo;t too disappointed that they lost the ghost she was so excited to find.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;What do we do now?&rdquo; Trixie asks.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Whatever you want,&rdquo; Katya responds, &ldquo;we could explore more of the woods?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie hesitates at that, not sure if she wants to stay here longer than she already has, especially not after they met a ghost that nearly caused them hearing damage.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Or we could leave, I saw a ghost that&rsquo;s enough for me,&rdquo; Katya adds, not wanting Trixie to feel obligated to continue their ghost hunt.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure?&rdquo; Trixie asks tentatively, &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t be disappointed if we just go home?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya shrugs, and Trixie can tell she&rsquo;s trying to be more sure than she is, that she&rsquo;s hiding a bit of disappointment, &ldquo;we saw what I wanted to, but we could always go to one of the other places on the list, the night is young.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re scared?&rdquo; Katya asks, more for clarification than for confusion, making sure she didn&rsquo;t hear the ghost incorrectly.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the ghost responds, whispering, sounding unsure and looking back up at them despite avoiding contact for the last however long.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;What are you scared of?&rdquo; it&rsquo;s Trixie who asks the question, confused, and intrigued that a ghost has the ability to feel such a human emotion like fear. But the fear is evident in the ghost&rsquo;s appearance, she&rsquo;s changed color to a soft red color, and the edges of her look fuzzy like she&rsquo;s radiating the fear out of her. It makes her look smaller and less intimidating and Trixie wants to reach out and hold her.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Me and my friend came to look around the woods for fun, but we stayed past sundown and couldn&rsquo;t find our way out. When I got tired of walking around, my friend told me to rest and went out in search of help while I sat and waited, I haven&rsquo;t seen her or anyone else since,&rdquo; the ghost responds, she sounds detached from the situation, like she&rsquo;s telling any random story rather than the last experience she probably had while she was alive. It fills Trixie with sadness to know this girl died alone and afraid while in the woods, waiting for someone to return to her that never would. Katya squeezes her hand as if she can feel the sadness that has overtaken her.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya turns to her and they make eye contact, she can tell by the cloudiness in her eyes that Katya feels the overwhelming sadness too. She squeezes her girlfriend&rsquo;s hand to try to give her the support she needs, knowing how deeply Katya feels all of her emotions.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;So we&rsquo;re the first people you&rsquo;ve seen since your friend left?&rdquo; Katya asks to clarify the situation.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the ghost responds simply, and the edges of her form become more distorted, a physical representation of the distraught state that she&rsquo;s in.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;How long has it been?&rdquo; Trixie asks softly, she&rsquo;s trying very hard to be as caring as possible, feeling the need to be gentle for this scared ghost.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&hellip;.don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the ghost replies, and the energy she&rsquo;s emitting changes, becoming more aggressive. Trixie regrets asking, she&rsquo;s kicking herself for causing her more distress.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; Katya tries to comfort her, takes a tentative step forward to test the water, and drags Trixie along with her.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The ghost looks up at her and Katya stretches out her hand, keeps it hanging in the air in the hopes that the ghost might find some comfort in it. The ghost reaches out to her and takes Katya&rsquo;s hand and Trixie feels the hand holding hers tighten when the ghost hand meets Katya&rsquo;s. Trixie lets out a quiet gasp, in awe that the ghost&rsquo;s hand didn&rsquo;t move right through Katya&rsquo;s. The ghost seems to calm down slightly and smiles bashfully and gratefully at Katya.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The ghost releases Katya&rsquo;s hand after a few seconds, much calmer than she was before, and she floats back over to where she was previously, starts looking around the dark woods again.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie and Katya stand in stunned silence for a bit, watching the ghost.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Kat,&rdquo; Trixie says before she realizes she doesn&rsquo;t have anything else to say.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;What do we do?&rdquo; Katya asks back.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Trixie turns to look at her and sees her girlfriend's eyes filled with sadness and sympathy for the ghost.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We have to help her,&rdquo; Katya says as if it&rsquo;s the easiest thing in the world. Trixie&rsquo;s heart melts slightly at how willing Katya always is to drop everything to help someone, even random ghosts that they just met.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;How do we do that?&rdquo; Trixie asks, not even considering arguing with Katya about this.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Should we help look for her friend?&rdquo; Katya asks.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie considers it. She doesn&rsquo;t know the first thing about how to help a ghost. &ldquo;Katya her friend is gone, she&rsquo;s clearly from centuries ago,&rdquo; she&rsquo;s keeping her voice quiet, praying that the ghost can&rsquo;t hear her.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;What if her friend is a ghost too?&rdquo; Katya shoots back, her eyes are wide and Trixie can&rsquo;t tell if it&rsquo;s more fear or excitement.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;She could be, but what if her friend does come back and we&rsquo;re gone?&rdquo; Trixie responds, she doesn&rsquo;t want to argue, but she wants to come to the best possible solution, she needs a plan.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya considers her point, &ldquo;I guess we could stay and wait with her for her friend?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;But what if her friend doesn&rsquo;t come back?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Katya bites her lip.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie squeezes her hand tight, she can feel the uncertainty radiating off of Katya, she&rsquo;s expecting Trixie to make the decision, but this is what Katya has been dreaming of her entire life. They&rsquo;ve met a ghost and she doesn&rsquo;t want Katya to leave disappointed that they didn&rsquo;t help her as much as they could.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;What do we do, baby?&rdquo; Trixie asks.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Why are you scared?&rdquo; Katya asks.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie can see the way that Katya is empathizing with this ghost, always able to feel for others in a way that Trixie can&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s one of the things she admires about her the most.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Why are you a ghost?&rdquo; Trixie asks. From the looks of it, she interrupted a conversation that she very much wasn&rsquo;t paying attention to, but she wants to know.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Trixie,&rdquo; Katya hisses at her quietly, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t just ask that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo; the ghost asks, ghostly head tilted at an awkward angle in confusion.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;A ghost,&rdquo; Trixie repeats, ignoring Katya&rsquo;s silent plea to stop what she&rsquo;s doing.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; the ghost says, her body glowing a dim red as her face grows concerned, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a ghost. Ghosts don&rsquo;t exist.&rdquo; she finishes firmly.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;But you are,&rdquo; Trixie says, &ldquo;a ghost I mean, you are a ghost.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;No I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; the ghost says, voice booming despite her not actually yelling. It startles them both with the volume, sounding like it&rsquo;s coming from all around them and not just the small, translucent body in front of them.&nbsp;</p>

	<div id="ch17" style="display:none;">
		<p>&ldquo;I think we should help her look for her friend,&rdquo; Katya sounds determined, like she&rsquo;s trying to convince herself that this is the right decision.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Trixie says, once again giving her hand a reassuring squeeze.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya nods once decidedly and starts walking toward the ghost. She&rsquo;s still floating around, looking lost, and trying to see deep into the darkness that is surrounding them.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna help you,&rdquo; Katya says. It startles the ghost and she whips around to face them at an unnaturally fast speed.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; the ghost questions, tilting her head curiously.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to help you,&rdquo; Katya repeats, her voice rising slightly in excitement.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The ghost sizes them up, looking them up and down skeptically before speaking again, &ldquo;how are you going to help me?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to help you look for your friend,&rdquo; Katya explains patiently.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The ghost&rsquo;s eyes widen in surprise and she shifts colors slightly, becoming less red than she was moments ago, &ldquo;you are?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Katya says excitedly, smiling brightly at the ghost in front of them.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Thank you so much!&rdquo; the ghost exclaims, spinning in a circle in delight.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Do you remember what direction they went in?&rdquo; Trixie asks, taking control of the situation and trying to come up with a solid plan.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure...I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; the ghost says quietly.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; Trixie quickly reassures her, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t we just start this way?&rdquo; she asks, pointing to her right.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>They all set off in that direction, switching the flashlights back on to search through the dense trees easier.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>They walk aimlessly through the woods, trying to stick to walking in only one direction, but it feels like the woods are constantly shifting around them and Trixie can&rsquo;t remember where they came from. It should be unsettling, but for some reason, she feels safe, like the woods are leading her to where they need to go.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>They get deeper and deeper into the woods, and the night seems endless, it feels like they&rsquo;ve been in the forest for hours but the moon is still high in the sky.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Eventually, they come across an opening in the woods, the trees part and there&rsquo;s grass beneath them, the moon is reflecting off of the dew that&rsquo;s glistening on the blades of grass below them, it&rsquo;s beautiful. They all slow down a little, taking in their surroundings and Trixie takes a deep breath, there&rsquo;s a slight breeze now that they aren&rsquo;t protected by trees.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>A peaceful quiet falls over them and they form a silent agreement to stand here and take a break. They&rsquo;re resting in the clearing when they hear something in the distance. The noise sounds far away and they can&rsquo;t make out what it is. Trixie&rsquo;s spine is at attention and she can feel the hair on her arms standing up.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>They all start walking again in the direction of the noise as if being drawn toward it and they all stay quiet waiting to hear the noise again. The noise continues periodically and they keep walking closer and closer hoping to be able to make out what is making the noise before they actually come face to face with it.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>They finally come within range of the sound and hear a voice calling out, &ldquo;Marlene!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The ghost turns a bright white, her eyes widening before she takes off quickly in the direction of the voice. Trixie and Katya trail behind, jogging to try to keep up with the ghost.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>By the time they catch up with the ghost, she&rsquo;s stopped moving entirely, her ghostly form wrapped around another glowing white figure, it&rsquo;s hard to tell where her body stops and the next one starts. They stand back and watch, not wanting to interrupt the reunion. They embrace for a long time, before breaking apart, both of them twirling together in a circle and laughing brightly, it brings a smile to both of their faces, and the woods feel warm with happiness.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The ghost, &lt;i&gt;<em>Marlene,&lt;/i&gt;</em> turns to face them, her smile wide, &ldquo;thank you so much,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;this is my friend.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Thank you for getting her back to me,&rdquo; the other ghost says then.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie and Katya both smile at them, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re welcome,&rdquo; they say practically in unison.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The two ghosts look back at each other and hug again, the relief pouring off of them in waves at finally finding each other again. Their embrace is tight and they watch as they both slowly start to fade away, eventually disappearing entirely leaving nothing behind but a melancholy air that surrounds them.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>For minutes they stand there staring at the empty space that the ghosts previously occupied. When they turn to face each other they both have tears in their eyes, but neither one of them feel sad, just different, emotional.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>They wordlessly hug each other, holding on tight. When they break apart Katya gives her a gentle kiss, wiping the tears from her cheeks with the pads of her thumbs.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; she asks quietly.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie nods and smiles, &ldquo;yeah, I&rsquo;m happy we reunited them.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; Katya replies, a soft smile growing on her face.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We should go home,&rdquo; Trixie says then, not making a move to actually do so.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Yeah, yeah we should go,&rdquo; Katya agrees, taking Trixie&rsquo;s hand once more and tearing their eyes apart.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>When they look around them, trying to figure out how to get out of the woods, they realize that they&rsquo;re back on the path that they started on. It&rsquo;s relief rather than fear that washes over them, and neither one of them questions it after what they just experienced, they just start walking back toward the car. They don&rsquo;t talk much, both of them processing the entire night in their own quiet ways, feeling like their entire worlds just changed suddenly.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie climbs back into the car laughing slightly at how the fear she felt coursing through her veins when they had arrived has been replaced by this odd sort of melancholy and a sense of just being &lt;i&gt;changed.&lt;/i&gt;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>As they drive off toward home, getting further away from the woods, they wonder how they&rsquo;re going to continue on in the normal world after learning that ghosts are real.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>They walk back over to the ghost to let her in on the plan, in their brief absences, she seems to have faded, barely visible even against the dark backdrop of the deep woods.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We want to help,&rdquo; Katya says, careful not to spook the poor girl again.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>She brightens again, more visible now, and for the first time a small smile starts to grow on her pale, glowing face.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; the ghost asks.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; Katya responds, as enthusiastic and eager to help as always.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The ghost moves toward them, faster than any living thing would be able to, a cool chill running through their bodies with her near.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; the ghost enthuses, &ldquo;thank you so much!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We think we should wait here,&rdquo; Trixie says, always the one to start making the plan happen, &ldquo;see if your friend comes back, that way you&rsquo;re not both looking for each other.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Do you think that will work?&rdquo; the ghost asks, looking scared and concerned once more.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s our best option,&rdquo; Trixie says. To be honest she doesn&rsquo;t think it will work, if this girl is a ghost, her friend is likely dead too, there&rsquo;s no saying if they would be a ghost too.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>They&rsquo;re in a somewhat clear area of the woods, the trees are high above their heads and the ground is clear of plants. They decide to get comfortable while they wait for who knows how long. The ground is cold without the sun heating it, and it&rsquo;s slightly wet, Trixie can feel herself starting to shiver, her muscles tense in the cold as they wait.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya scoothes closer to her, wrapping an arm around her, and Trixie leans into it, basking in the heat that Katya&rsquo;s body radiates constantly.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya stands, leaving her body cold where Katya was previously pressed against her, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna build a fire!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie squints her eyes at her, &ldquo;do you even know how to do that?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I can set fires with my mind, mother,&rdquo; she says in her creepy voice.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie sorts, rolling her eyes, and stands to help her girlfriend. She grew up in the woods, she knows what she&rsquo;s doing.</p>
		<p>***</p>
		<p>The fire crackles and flickers, bathing them in a soft glow. Trixie doesn&rsquo;t know if she&rsquo;s more transfixed by the way it illuminates Katya&rsquo;s sharp cheekbones or the way it filters through the translucency of the ghost, illuminating her from the inside.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>It&rsquo;s peaceful, the three of them sitting there, the ghost isn&rsquo;t so scared anymore, she seems as peaceful as they do, and Katya seems to be fighting her eyelids that are drooping heavier and heavier.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The sun starts to come up just when the fire is starting to die down, the soft, flickering glow of the fire being replaced by the glow of early morning. The sun is brighter than the fire and it hurts Trixie&rsquo;s eyes, blinding her for a moment and when she adjusts, blinking her eyes back open, the ghost is fainter than she has been all night, as if she&rsquo;s fading away.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>She shakes Katya lightly from where she was dozing off on her shoulder and by the time she wakes up, the ghost is gone. They both sit there staring at the empty space the ghost had occupied, a confusing mix of feelings in the air.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The friend never showed up, and the ghost faded away, gone completely and with no resolution and they&rsquo;re left sitting there wondering if they could have done more, without a resolution of their own.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>They stand slowly, taking their time to see if anything more will happen, but when nothing does they make their way out of the woods. They both feel slightly shell shocked, they caught a glimpse of life after death, of a soul trapped with no end, and they don&rsquo;t yet know how to cope. By night, they&rsquo;ll wonder if they should return, find the ghost and try again, provide company to a lost soul that cries out in loneliness at night.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Katya says, voice raised to be heard over the echo of the ghost&rsquo;s voice, &ldquo;she didn&rsquo;t mean it. We believe you, you&rsquo;re not a ghost.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>She&rsquo;s holding Trixie&rsquo;s hand tightly, squeezing in a warning to not mess this up.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a ghost,&rdquo; the ghost repeats, her voice still loud, but not booming the way it was, her red color seems to be fading slightly too.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; Katya says, using the voice she uses to calm Trixie down when things aren&rsquo;t working the way she wants them to.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The ghost returns to her original translucent clear, standing quietly before them, unsure what to do now.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re scared?&rdquo; Katya asks again, Trixie having interrupted the ghost&rsquo;s response earlier.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the ghost responds, whispering, sounding unsure and looking back up at them despite avoiding contact for the last however long.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;What are you scared of?&rdquo; it&rsquo;s Trixie who asks the question, confused, and intrigued that a ghost has the ability to feel such a human emotion like fear. Katya cuts her a sharp looking, warning her not to say something else to anger the ghost.</p>
		<p>The fear is evident in the ghost&rsquo;s appearance, she&rsquo;s changed color to a soft red color again, but it&rsquo;s different somehow to the earlier red when she was angry and Trixie doesn&rsquo;t know how she knows that. The edges of her look fuzzy like she&rsquo;s radiating the fear out of her, vibrating quickly. It makes her look smaller and less intimidating and Trixie wants to reach out and hold her.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Me and my friend came to look around the woods for fun, but we stayed past sundown and couldn&rsquo;t find our way out. When I got tired of walking around, my friend told me to rest and went out in search of help while I sat and waited, I haven&rsquo;t seen her or anyone else since,&rdquo; the ghost responds, she sounds detached from the situation, like she&rsquo;s telling any random story rather than the last experience she probably had while she was alive. It fills Trixie with sadness to know this girl died alone and afraid while in the woods, waiting for someone to return to her that never would. Katya squeezes her hand as if she can feel the sadness that has overtaken her.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya turns to her and they make eye contact, she can tell by the cloudiness in her eyes that Katya feels the overwhelming sadness too. She squeezes her girlfriend&rsquo;s hand to try to give her the support she needs, knowing how deeply Katya feels all of her emotions.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;So we&rsquo;re the first people you&rsquo;ve seen since your friend left?&rdquo; Katya asks to clarify the situation.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the ghost responds simply, and the edges of her form become more distorted, a physical representation of the distraught state that she&rsquo;s in.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;How long has it been?&rdquo; Trixie asks softly, she&rsquo;s trying very hard to be as caring as possible, feeling the need to be gentle for this scared ghost.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&hellip;.don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the ghost replies, and the energy she&rsquo;s emitting changes, becomes more aggressive and Trixie regrets asking, she&rsquo;s kicking herself for causing her more distress.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; Katya tries to comfort her, takes a tentative step forward to test the water, and drags Trixie along with her.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The ghost looks up at her and Katya stretches out her hand, keeps it hanging in the air in the hopes that the ghost might find some comfort in it. The ghost reaches out to her and takes Katya&rsquo;s hand and Trixie feels the hand holding hers tighten when the ghost hand meets Katya&rsquo;s. Trixie lets out a quiet gasp, in awe that the ghost&rsquo;s hand didn&rsquo;t move right through Katya&rsquo;s. The ghost seems to calm down slightly and smiles bashfully and gratefully at Katya.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;What do we do?&rdquo; Katya asks back.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Yes you are!&rdquo; Trixie defends, never one to back down, even to an actual ghost.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The ghost rushes toward Trixie with supernatural speed, and she stumbles back, being held up only by Katya&rsquo;s tight grip on her arm. The ghost hovers menacingly over her, she seems to have grown and the red light she&rsquo;s emanating has grown brighter, it feels warm on Trixie&rsquo;s face when the ghost&rsquo;s face inches closer to her own.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya pushes Trixie back, putting her own body in between Trixie&rsquo;s and the ghost&rsquo;s. She&rsquo;s tiny compared to the ghost.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Leave her alone,&rdquo; Katya says firmly, with only a slight waver in her voice, &ldquo;she didn&rsquo;t mean it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The ghost inches closer to them and Trixie squeezes her eyes shut, too scared to keep them open and see what is about to happen. She feels powerless and fearful that her own decision and Katya&rsquo;s need to protect her is going to get her girlfriend hurt.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Her eyes are still closed when she feels a puff of air wash over her body. She keeps her eyes screwed shut and feels her breathing growing more and more erratic.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Trixie open your eyes,&rdquo; Katya whispers, Trixie can feel her breath close to her face.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie shakes her head, not willing to open her eyes at all.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Come on, you can open them, it&rsquo;s okay baby,&rdquo; Katya whispers again, and Trixie calms down slightly at the tone she&rsquo;s using.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>She pries one eye open, keeping it squinted just in case she needs to snap them closed again quickly. She looks around and doesn&rsquo;t see the ghost anywhere, all she sees is Katya looking at her with worried eyes. She pulls her other eye open, moves her head around to make sure the ghost is actually gone, and when she&rsquo;s sure that it is she lets her body fall into Katya&rsquo;s. She feels slender arms wrapping around her shaking body and holding her tight, Katya&rsquo;s hand rubbing up and down Trixie&rsquo;s back comfortingly.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, it&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; Katya is reassuring her over and over.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie finally calms down enough to be able to move away from Katya&rsquo;s embrace, look at her face again, &ldquo;where did it go?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Katya shrugs, &ldquo;it got angry and then it just sort of...blew away.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie nods her head, not sure she&rsquo;s absorbing the information, but relieved that the ghost isn&rsquo;t around anymore, that they&rsquo;re safe. &ldquo;What do we do now?&rdquo; she asks.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;What do you want to do? Are you okay? Do you want to go home?&rdquo; Katya asks in response, her hands are still on Trixie&rsquo;s arms as if she thinks Trixie will collapse if she isn&rsquo;t being supported.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay,&rdquo; Trixie responds despite not really feeling okay at all, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you want to look for the ghost?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We already saw it, that&rsquo;s enough for me,&rdquo; Katya replies, and Trixie can tell that it&rsquo;s only a half-truth, that she wants to keep ghost hunting and that she&rsquo;s only saying that so Trixie won&rsquo;t feel guilty if she wants them to go home, or even guiltier because it was her fault the ghost got angry and left, it&rsquo;s so sweet and so Katya and it makes her heart clench.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay if you want to keep going,&rdquo; Trixie tells her, she doesn&rsquo;t want Katya to give up when she&rsquo;s so close to achieving her dream.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I think we should try looking for it,&rdquo; Trixie says.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; Katya responds, her thumb rubbing the back of Trixie&rsquo;s hand comfortingly, &ldquo;we already saw a ghost, we can leave if you want.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Trixie can tell Katya wants to stay, she&rsquo;s giving Trixie an out but Trixie would feel bad taking it. This is Katya&rsquo;s dream and she&rsquo;s not gonna stop her from going after it, especially not now that they&rsquo;ve come this far.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; she says, squeezing Katya&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go look.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Okay!&rdquo; Katya exclaims excitedly, tugging Trixie by the arm to get her moving.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>They walk aimlessly, Katya leading them through the darkness of the woods for what feels like miles.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Katya,&rdquo; Trixie says, trying to gain her attention.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Hmm,&rdquo; Katya mumbles, still walking determinedly.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Baby,&rdquo; Trixie says gently as she stops walking.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya doesn&rsquo;t stop until their arms are too far apart to hold on and she turns back to look at Trixie, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re gonna find her,&rdquo; she says calmly.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We just need to keep looking!&rdquo; Katya says emphatically, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s out here somewhere!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been walking for hours, the sun is gonna start rising soon, I don&rsquo;t think we are going to find her,&rdquo; Trixie is trying very hard not to raise her voice, but her feet are killing her and she&rsquo;s <em>tired,</em> she just wants to take a nice, hot shower and climb into bed.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya looks devastated and Trixie steps closer to her, pulling her into a comforting hug.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she says into the crown of Katya&rsquo;s head.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; Katya says, &ldquo;we tried.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie feels bad, Katya is happy-go-lucky, always excited just to be alive and seeing her disappointed always makes her heart ache.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We could try somewhere else?&rdquo; she suggests. She doesn&rsquo;t exactly <em>want</em> to try ghost hunting somewhere else, but if it will cheer her girlfriend up, she&rsquo;ll do it.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Katya says, face still pressed against Trixie&rsquo;s shoulder, &ldquo;maybe we should just go home.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

		<p>They head toward the light and as they get closer they can hear voices. From this distance, they can&rsquo;t quite make out what they&rsquo;re saying.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>They make eye contact with each other, silently discussing whether they should keep going or not. They&rsquo;re careful with their steps, trying not to make enough noise to alert the people of their location.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>They&rsquo;re coming toward a clearing and the light is getting brighter, they can see the silhouettes of a group of people sitting around the fire. They look like they&rsquo;re having fun, they can hear laughter mixing with the crackling roar of the large fire they&rsquo;re gathered around.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>They don&rsquo;t look like they&rsquo;re dangerous, but then again they&rsquo;re in the middle of the woods, away from civilization on Halloween night.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Should we go talk to them?&rdquo; Katya whispers to Trixie.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Are you crazy? You do not talk to strangers in the middle of the woods, have you seen any horror movie ever?&rdquo; Trixie responds, trying to keep her voice quiet.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;But maybe they&rsquo;re ghost hunting too!&rdquo; Katya says. Trixie should have expected this, Katya loves to gather friends wherever she goes and she always does it with ease, making connections with anyone she talks to.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;What are the chances they&rsquo;re also here to ghost hunt?&rdquo; Trixie says, doubt creeping into her voice.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;What are the chances they&rsquo;re murderers?&rdquo; Katya counters.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Touch&eacute;,&rdquo; Trixie responds, still not convinced that they won&rsquo;t get murdered if they approach these people.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s go say hi,&rdquo; Katya says, once again taking Trixie by the hand and leading her over to the group of people.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie is hesitant, still not convinced that this is the smartest idea, but she trusts Katya. Kind of.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The closer they get, the more they can hear coming from the people. Trixie can hear laughter and it should put her at ease, but somehow hearing laughter at midnight in the middle of woods isn&rsquo;t as calming as she expected.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; Katya says brightly when they&rsquo;re close enough to make out their faces.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Five heads whip around to look at them, one of them letting out a yelp, hand over their heart.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; the man sitting across from them responds, &ldquo;you make a habit of sneaking up on people in the woods?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya laughs awkwardly, &ldquo;sorry, we didn&rsquo;t mean to scare you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you sit down,&rdquo; the man offers. They seem friendly enough, some of them returning to their previous conversations and paying them no mind.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>They sit down, letting the fire warm them and enjoying the energy of the people around them.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;So what are you guys doing out here?&rdquo; Katya says, already feeling at home.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Ghost hunting,&rdquo; the man across from them responds.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya whips her head around to face Trixie, finger pointing at her face, &ldquo;I told you!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie rolls her eyes, &ldquo;yeah, yeah, yeah.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Have you had any luck?&rdquo; Katya asks.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Not so far, haven&rsquo;t been able to find her yet,&rdquo; the man directly across from them responds.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Her?&rdquo; Katya questions, intrigued by the response.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; the man says, sounding very casual about the matter, &ldquo;her, the old witch.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie and Katya share a look, intrigued and confused.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me you haven&rsquo;t heard about the old witch?&rdquo; the man asks, sounding shocked at their ignorance.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Not ringing any bells,&rdquo; Trixie responds.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re searching the woods for the ghosts without knowing who it is you&rsquo;re looking for?&rdquo; the man asks.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t know you had to be a historian to hunt ghosts,&rdquo; Trixie says back, not liking feeling like she&rsquo;s being condescended to.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya slaps the side of her thigh, giving her a look that says &lt;i&gt;<em>be nice,</em>&lt;/i&gt; &ldquo;sorry, what about an old witch?&rdquo; Katya asks politely, wanting all the help and information she can get.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;A long time ago, there was a woman that lived in these woods, nobody knew where, her house was never found, likely she had some sort of spell on it to make it invisible, but she had a little black cat. She would wander these woods, looking for materials for her potions and spells, and it was said you could summon her if you left her an offering at the circle of rocks over that way,&rdquo; her explains, pointing to his left vaguely into the dark woods.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;For years she lived in peace, accepting the offerings people left her and offering them help in return until the faithful day of her death.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie and Katya are transfixed, hanging on his every word, dying to find out how this story will end.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;One day, a woman left an offering and the witch accepted it, as usual. She asked the woman what she wanted in return, offering her services, and the woman asked for something terrible. The witch didn&rsquo;t want to do it, she didn&rsquo;t like using her powers for bad. The woman was insistent, not letting up, not asking for anything else, and the witch had to give in. She cast a spell, and the next day the woman&rsquo;s husband woke up with his eyes bloodied, eyesight gone, the witch had cursed him upon the woman&rsquo;s request, angry that he had looked at another woman. The townspeople were shocked, fearful that they may be next, and they hanged her. The woman never spoke of her offering the witch, allowing her to take the blame and watching with guilt as the witch was put to death.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie and Katya gasp, shocked by the ending of the story.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s said that she still walks these woods, that you can still summon her from the circle of rocks.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; Katya whispers in awe.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; Trixie echoes, but bluntly, not quite believing what is clearly a campfire story.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Is that true?&rdquo; Katya asks, her eyes still shimmering with wonder, ignoring Trixie&rsquo;s pessimism.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Of course it is,&rdquo; the man says emphatically.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; the man sitting next to Trixie says, leaning closer to her conspiratorially, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just a story parents tell their kids to keep them out of the woods.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie nods, respecting the honesty and Katya stands up abruptly.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Thank you for the information, we have some business to take care of,&rdquo; she says, trying to get Trixie to stand up by tugging on her elbow.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie complies, standing up and walking away with Katya to a chorus of pleasant goodbyes.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Katya, that story wasn&rsquo;t real,&rdquo; Trixie says.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; Katya responds.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Come on, a witch ghost?&rdquo; Trixie says, disbelief in her voice.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in Massachusetts! There were women being killed for witchcraft all the time!&rdquo; Katya argues, voice passionate.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Yeah, but they weren&rsquo;t actually witches!&rdquo; Trixie responds.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;But what if this one was?&rdquo; Katya says, she sounds so excited, so hopeful.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; Trixie sighs, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go look for the witch.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Katya cheers, &ldquo;I knew I was dating you for a reason.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie rolls her eyes, and gives Katya a shove, &ldquo;just lead the way, idiot.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya smiles brightly, turning and starting back into the woods. Trixie immediately misses the warmth of the fire, feeling the cold seep deep into her bones. They walk in the direction the man pointed in during his story, Katya moving her flashlight around to look for any clues.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The woods are quiet and it stretches out, seeming like it gets even quieter the further they walk. The trees are getting less dense and the sky is more visible now, stars littering the sky beautifully, and then suddenly there&rsquo;s a clearing. And rocks. Multiple. In a circle.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Holy shit,&rdquo; Katya says, &ldquo;it was true.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie&rsquo;s lips are parted in shock, trying to process.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;He could&rsquo;ve made up a story based off of a landmark,&rdquo; she reasons, &ldquo;to trick people when they go looking and find it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Stop being such a buzzkill,&rdquo; Katya scolds her, walking forward further until she&rsquo;s in the middle of the rocks.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie joins her, and the air feels different in the middle of the rocks, the hair on her arms standing at attention like there&rsquo;s some sort of electricity running between the rocks.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;This feels weird,&rdquo; she says.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably the witch, she left magic behind,&rdquo; Katya says, walking slowly around the circle, shining her light and observing each rock closely.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie rolls her eyes. She can&rsquo;t deny that there is something that feels &lt;i&gt;<em>special</em>&lt;/i&gt; about this place, but she refuses to believe in a stupid campfire story that some man told them just to freak out two defenseless women in the woods. No thank you.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;What should we do?&rdquo; Katya asks when she finishes looking at the rocks, facing Trixie again.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Do you have an <em>offering</em> for her?&rdquo; Trixie asks sarcastically.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Ha ha,&rdquo; Katya responds dryly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have anything to offer though. I doubt she&rsquo;ll want your sorry ass.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Trixie defends, &ldquo;she would be lucky to have me as an offering.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Are you volunteering?&rdquo; Katya smiles cheekily at her.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, someone has to make sure you don&rsquo;t die out here alone,&rdquo; Trixie argues.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Seriously though what now?&rdquo; Katya asks again.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just wait here for a while,&rdquo; Trixie suggests, she&rsquo;s tired of walking anyway.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Good idea!&rdquo; Katya exclaims, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll show up soon.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya sits down on the ground, wiggling around to get comfy. Trixie reluctantly joins her, the ground is cold and slightly wet and it sends a shiver up her spine. Katya scoots closer, wrapping an arm around Trixie and letting her rest her body against her.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>They wait for only a short while, just enjoying the night and each other&rsquo;s presence, when they hear a rustling at the edge of the woods. Both of them turn to look, Katya excitedly, and Trixie in fear that it&rsquo;s a bear or a bobcat.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Out of the brush pops a small black cat. Katya immediately jumps to her feet, &ldquo;Trixie look!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie stands up too, in complete shock. This is either a crazy coincidence, or maybe, just maybe, the story is actually true.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell me you don&rsquo;t believe him now,&rdquo; Katya says.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Trixie responds, still unsure and more than a little shocked.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The cat walks closer to them, pausing to weave its way between their legs, before it walks past them, pausing at the edge of the rocks and looking back at them. It sits up, like it&rsquo;s waiting for them to come closer.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I think it wants us to follow,&rdquo; Katya says.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s follow it,&rdquo; Trixie concedes. Coincidence or not, she kind of wants to find out what&rsquo;s gonna happen next.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya smiles at her, &ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d give in.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie just rolls her eyes, and they start walking. They&rsquo;re a few paces behind the cat when it starts walking again, leading them back into the trees.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The cat walks swiftly, both girls working hard to keep up, winding between trees deeper and deeper into the woods. They walk for close to twenty minutes when the cat disappears from view, walking quickly behind a particularly large tree. They walk around the tree, looking to see where the cat went, but instead they find a small cottage. The lights are on inside, a warm yellow glow emanating from the round windows on the front of the house. There&rsquo;s smoke coming from the chimney and it looks warm despite its stone exterior, welcoming.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It led us to her, this has to be the witch&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; Katya says.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie is silent, eyes wide as she takes in the house and the events of the night. At this point she really can&rsquo;t deny the truth of the story they were told. All of this being a coincidence is more of a stretch than a ghost story being true.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The cat reappears in their vision, stopped at the front door of the house, sitting up straight, looking at them.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We should go inside,&rdquo; Katya suggests.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;What? No, we can&rsquo;t just walk into someone&rsquo;s house, especially not when they live alone in the middle of the woods, are you crazy?&rdquo; Trixie responds, one of them needs to stay logical, no matter how insane this all is.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll knock!&rdquo; Katya argues back.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Oh like that will change the whole living alone in the middle of the woods thing,&rdquo; Trixie deadpans.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Come on, you heard the story, she&rsquo;s nice!&rdquo; Katya defends.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Yeah and dead!&rdquo; Trixie shoots back.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya doesn&rsquo;t respond, just gives Trixie a look and Trixie stares right back, neither of them backing down.&nbsp;</p>

	<div id="ch27" style="display:none;">
		<p>Trixie sighs deeply, &ldquo;lead the way,&rdquo; she says, curiosity once again getting the better of her.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya takes her hand with a smile, leading her to the front door of the cottage.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The cat moves again, nudging the door open with its little head. The warmth of the house hits their faces and Katya peaks her head in before stepping inside.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The house is bigger inside than it looked from outside but it&rsquo;s still cozy.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>There&rsquo;s a fire crackling in the fireplace, plants hung from the ceiling wrapped in string, knitted blankets draped over various surfaces, and colorful decor decorating the entire place.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The cat leads them deeper into the house and they round a wall, coming face to face with a middle aged woman stirring something on the stovetop. The cat weaves between the woman&rsquo;s feet and she bends down to pet it, scratching its chin as it begins purring. She&rsquo;s whispering to the cat as it meows at her and she stands back up, turning around to face Trixie and Katya who have remained silent. She doesn&rsquo;t seem at all surprised to see them, in fact, she smiles warmly at them.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Hello girls,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;come in, sit, you must be tired from your walk.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie and Katya look at each other, and then sit down. Trixie isn&rsquo;t sure why she was so willing to do so, but the stranger seems friendly, the whole house is welcoming, a feeling of calm settling in her chest even though she should be uncomfortable and scared still.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just mixing up a potion,&rdquo; the woman says, returning to the pot that&rsquo;s simmering on the stove still, &ldquo;can I offer you some? It&rsquo;ll warm you right up.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie and Katya make eye contact once more, there&rsquo;s no sense of danger, they feel calm, but they still know better than to accept a &lt;i&gt;<em>potion</em>&lt;/i&gt; from a stranger.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- <p><em>&lt;i&gt;If you choose to drink the potion, go to chapter 28&nbsp;</em></p>

	</div>

	<div id="ch28" style="display:none;">
		<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; Katya responds enthusiastically. <br /><br />Trixie looks at her like she&rsquo;s insane. They don&rsquo;t know this woman. She lives in the middle of the woods. They should not accept something she referred to as a &lt;i&gt;<em>potion</em>&lt;/i&gt; so readily. Katya shrugs at her, she seems calm, not at all worried about putting this mystery substance in her body, and Trixie has to admit that she does feel safe here.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Yeah, why not,&rdquo; she says, if Katya is going to drink it she&rsquo;s going to too, they&rsquo;re in this together.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The woman smiles at them, ladling three mugs full of the bubbling liquid. She sets two of them on the table in front of them before turning back to take her own and joining them at the table.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie takes the mug in her hands, despite it still bubbling in her mug it doesn&rsquo;t feel hot, it&rsquo;s lukewarm and she feels the warmth seep into the palms of her hands, spreading through her body all the way to her toes. Katya is already taking a sip of hers, but Trixie takes her time, she brings it closer to her face and inhales, it smells faintly of licorice with something floral in it too. It&rsquo;s shimmering slightly, as if it&rsquo;s glowing from within, and she takes a deep breath before sipping it. She feels it move all the way through her system, glowing warm down her throat, through her chest, and into the pit of her stomach. It&rsquo;s a deep warmth that feels almost like hot sparks that spreads through her entire body, a sensation she&rsquo;s never felt before.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>It feels good and she takes another sip, a bigger one this time, and she starts to feel like she&rsquo;s floating away even though this is the most present she has maybe ever felt.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>She turns to look at Katya and finds her completely peaceful, she&rsquo;s sitting still instead of in constant motion like normal. Katya opens her eyes and looks into Trixie&rsquo;s. Trixie can feel Katya&rsquo;s calm wash over her like a gentle wave, a shared emotion between the two of them. It feels tangible somehow.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You can feel it can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; the woman asks, looking at them knowingly.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Feel what?&rdquo; Trixie questions. Katya is nodding beside her.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;The connection,&rdquo; the woman responds, &ldquo;how interconnected everything is.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya nods again, smiling at Trixie. The cat has hopped up into Katya&rsquo;s lap and Katya is petting it gently. The cat is purring loudly and the sound vibrates the air around them, buzzing in their chests.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; Trixie asks, gesturing to her mug that still has a small amount of liquid in it.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a potion,&rdquo; the woman answers, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s meant to open up your mind, let you feel the truth of the universe.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie nods along, normally she would say this lady is insane, but she can feel that she&rsquo;s telling the truth, she can feel the way the universe is interacting with her and how she&rsquo;s impacting it. How she&rsquo;s so insignificant in the grand scheme of things and yet in this moment, and for the short time of her existence, she is significant.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>It makes something come alive in her chest, as if a new space has been created in it where she can breathe just a little deeper.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what life is about,&rdquo; the woman says, &ldquo;that feeling you have in your chest, the way it feels expanded, like there&rsquo;s a spark in there that you can breathe into and create a flame, that&rsquo;s what life is about, finding things that make you feel that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You can feel it too?&rdquo; Katya asks.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie looks between the two of them, she thought that was her feeling, but just like the feeling of calm that she absorbed from Katya, this feeling of passion in her chest seems to have spread to the others. Or maybe it was spread to her.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We are all connected,&rdquo; the woman explains, &ldquo;we can share our emotions, humans are meant to connect, to understand each other, and the two of you are bonded, you can sense each other easily and I can feel it too.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie takes the hand Katya isn&rsquo;t using to pet the cat, holding it loosely in her own, a physical extension of the connection they have.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya hums, taking in this information. She can feel it all within herself, she knows that this woman is right, that the universe is there to push people together, to give you people that will understand and be understood.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>They sit in silence, but it&rsquo;s not quiet, the universe is alive around them and their thoughts are moving freely through them and around them.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>In a few hours the potion will wear off, they&rsquo;ll grow tired, letting their eyes drift shut into a more peaceful sleep than they have ever had. When they wake up again, the woman will be gone, as will the house around them. They&rsquo;ll find themselves tucked gently into their own bed, unsure how they got home. The previous night feels surreal, but not in a way that feels like a dream, it&rsquo;s surreal in the way that they know it happened but they can&rsquo;t explain how. There&rsquo;s a newfound calm over their lives, they have a deeper understanding of themselves and the world around them and they cherish the memories they now share, not telling anyone, but not forgetting either.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;No thank you,&rdquo; Trixie says before Katya does anything stupid. You know, like drinking a mysterious <em>potion</em> that some strange woman that lives in the middle of the woods is offering them.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Suit yourself,&rdquo; she shrugs, using a ladle to scoop a portion of the bubbling silver liquid into a mug that looks like it&rsquo;s been hand painted.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>When the woman has a full mug of steaming, bubbling liquid, she sits down with them at the table. She seems unbothered, like she was expecting them, or at least used to random people wandering into her house. They sit in silence, the woman seems to feel comfortable with it, gently blowing on her drink but Trixie feels it stretching out. The longer she sits there the more questions she has and this silence is answering none of them.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie clears her throat, &ldquo;So, why do you live in the middle of the woods?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya kicks her leg under the table, wishing Trixie could just be subtle for once in her life.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my home,&rdquo; the woman answers simply, she doesn&rsquo;t seem at all offended by the question.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you get lonely?&rdquo; Trixie asks.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the woman responds, &ldquo;I have plenty to keep me company.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>As if to prove her point, the cat hops up on the table, walking in front of Katya and bowing its head to sniff her hands that are resting on the table.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya lifts a hand to scratch at the cats head, &ldquo;like this little guy?&rdquo; she asks, cooing at the cat who is preening at her attention.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;The cat, the trees, the souls wandering the forest, there&rsquo;s plenty around to keep you company if you&rsquo;re willing to see it,&rdquo; the woman explains.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>They go silent at that, taking in the woman&rsquo;s words, until Trixie lets out a loud scream of a laugh, &ldquo;what the fuck does that mean?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The cat jumps off the table, running away at the sudden loud noise and Katya lets her forehead thump against the wood.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The woman smiles, &ldquo;you have so much to learn, you think I&rsquo;m the one that&rsquo;s crazy but you&rsquo;re the one choosing to walk around with your eyes closed.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Honey, my eyes are wide open,&rdquo; Trixie responds, indignant at the way this woman is talking down to her.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Physically yes, but spiritually you haven&rsquo;t opened them yet,&rdquo; the woman responds, still not offended or deterred by Trixie&rsquo;s mocking.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya puts her hand over Trixie&rsquo;s mouth when she tries to respond again, taking control of the situation, &ldquo;how do we open our eyes?&rdquo; she asks, curious to learn whatever wisdom this odd woman has to offer. She moves her hand from Trixie&rsquo;s mouth, moving it to her thigh instead and Trixie sits back in her chair, crossing her arms indignantly.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The woman hums in response, taking a second to think of her answer, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t force it, you just need to be willing to see the truth when it&rsquo;s presented to you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie rolls her eyes, scoffing quietly.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You take life too seriously,&rdquo; the woman says, looking into Trixie&rsquo;s eyes, &ldquo;you only see what is in front of you, but there is so much more out there, I hope you will learn to see it someday.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Trixie says sarcastically. She&rsquo;s smart, she knows about life, she has her eyes open and no crazy lady in the woods is gonna tell her she&rsquo;s stupid.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about her,&rdquo; Katya says, slapping her lightly on the thigh again, side-eyeing her harshly.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; the woman says calmly, turning to Katya now, &ldquo;you seem willing, your eyes will open soon and I think you may be the key in opening hers too,&rdquo; she says, nodding in Trixie&rsquo;s direction.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya smiles brightly at that, turning to Trixie who is getting grumpier by the minute.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>They&rsquo;ll stay here for a while, until the sun starts to come up and they start to feel tired. The woman will answer their questions, speaking in words that they don&rsquo;t quite understand. Trixie rolls her eyes, listening to a woman that is clearly out of her mind ramble to them, while Katya hangs intently on her every word, trying to burn these words into her memory forever. They may not have found a ghost, but they feel as though something has changed.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>In a couple of weeks they&rsquo;ll come back to the woods, searching for the house again to no avail, maybe it was a dream they had or a hallucination brought on by exhaustion from their exploring, but it&rsquo;s left an impression on them that they will not forget.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; Trixie sighs, giving in to Katya&rsquo;s silent pleas.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Katya exclaims, &ldquo;come on,&rdquo; she demands, moving quickly in the direction of the light, pulling Trixie with her.</p>
		<p>They walk toward the light and it seems like they&rsquo;re rapidly approaching it. When they first spotted it it seemed to be somewhat far away, but in a matter of minutes it seems that they are mere yards away, as if they&rsquo;re being pulled toward the light.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The light is glowing through the trees, illuminating the area around them in a cool blue tone, it seems to have a slight pulse, dimming gently before glowing brightly again. They weave through the trees until they can see the source of the light.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>It appears to be a person, but not made of flesh and bones, but light. The light isn&rsquo;t coming from within them, it is them, and they&rsquo;re pacing back and forth at a steady pace, the light pulsing not quite like breathing or a heartbeat. The being seems like they&rsquo;re thinking, lost in their own head.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>They stand transfixed, unsure of what they are seeing, it feels as if they&rsquo;re in a dream, the being&rsquo;s glow casting a haze over the whole experience.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Trixie, we found a ghost,&rdquo; Katya whispers, excitement clear in her voice.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie looks over to find a huge smile on Katya&rsquo;s face and she can&rsquo;t help but feel her own grow at the sight.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;What should we do now?&rdquo; Katya asks.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Trixie responds, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never found a ghost before.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Me either,&rdquo; Katya says.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I think we should try to talk to it,&rdquo; Katya says.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Trixie agrees. She&rsquo;s a little shocked Katya&rsquo;s ghost hunting plan actually worked, so at this point she may as well follow her lead.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya nods, and turns toward the being, taking a few more steps so that they&rsquo;re closer to the being.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Katya calls out, her voice is loud enough to be heard across the small distance, but not yelling, she doesn&rsquo;t want to scare the ghost.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The ghost whips around, the glow brightening until it hurts to look at and the air seems to grow colder.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; the ghost asks, fear in their voice.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; Katya says, hand stretched out to placate the ghost and to block the nearly blinding light, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Katya,&rdquo; she says before she points to Trixie, &ldquo;and this is Trixie.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; the ghost asks. The light has died down only slightly, enough for Katya to lower her hand, but she&rsquo;s still defensive.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We were just taking a walk,&rdquo; Katya says, it&rsquo;s sort of the truth, &ldquo;what are you doing here?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; the ghost starts, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo; The light flares up again, the ghost looking distraught, the light is pulsing faster this time.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Are you lost?&rdquo; Katya asks, she&rsquo;s slowly moving closer to the ghost, leaving Trixie behind her to try and comfort the ghost as best as she can.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; the ghost responds, sounding out of it before she snaps her head up to look at Katya, looking more sure now, &ldquo;yes, I&rsquo;m lost, I was with my friend, but then we got separated and now I can&rsquo;t find her,&rdquo; she explains.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Okay, do you need some help?&rdquo; Katya asks, more than willing to offer help at the drop of a hat, even for a ghost.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t know what to do,&rdquo; the ghost starts to panic, lighting up bright again, and returning to pacing back and forth, quicker this time.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie moves up to where Katya is standing, taking her hand again.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;What do we do?&rdquo; she asks Katya, trying to stay calm.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We need to help her,&rdquo; Katya responds easily.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;How do we do that?&rdquo; Trixie asks, not sure how to proceed with helping a panicking ghost looking for a lost friend that may or may not be alive.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s help her out of the woods,&rdquo; Trixie suggests, &ldquo;in case she&rsquo;s trapped here.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Katya responds, walking closer to the ghost now that they have a decision, &ldquo;we want to help you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; the ghost questions.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna help you get out of here and then we can get some help to find your friend,&rdquo; Trixie explains.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The ghost lights up a little brighter, her face looking less sunken in, &ldquo;thank you, thank you so much!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; Katya responds, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go get some help!&rdquo; she says excitedly.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The ghost spins in a circle, following closely behind them as they start walking back in the direction they came from. The woods are less confusing this time, as if it is leading them in a certain direction. In almost no time they&rsquo;ve made it back to the original path that led them from their car into the woods. It took far less time than it took them to find the ghost, like the trees were making way for them to make their way back.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>They walk along the path, the ghost floating happily beside them as Katya hums idly.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;There it is!&rdquo; the ghost cries excitedly when they see the opening in the woods, the parking lot a hundred or so yards in front of them.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The ghost starts moving a little faster, impatiently making her way out of the woods that have trapped her. They make it to the edge and pause. The ghost looks around in wonder, more open air and sky here than she&rsquo;s used to after this much time in the dense forest.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We made it,&rdquo; Katya says, smiling at the ghost who is buzzing with energy.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Thank you for helping me,&rdquo; the ghost says. She starts to fade subtly and Trixie almost doesn&rsquo;t notice, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t forget your kindness.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Just like that, the ghost fades entirely, a bright light glowing in her place for a moment.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Nothing else happens, but they can feel something different. There&rsquo;s an energy around them left behind by the ghost, it feels calm, peaceful, and they know that it means she&rsquo;s been freed, sent to somewhere better where she can finally rest even without anything being said. They stand there for a while, looking at the space the ghost occupied. When they feel the air around them settle, they walk slowly to their car, still hand in hand.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>They drive home, both of them feeling at peace, thankful that they could help the young ghost finally rest. Something about the experience felt religious, like they were in the presence of a higher power, and a comfort settles between them, knowing that there is something after all of this.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;We should stay with her,&rdquo; Katya decides, &ldquo;we should keep her company.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Trixie responds, relieved that Katya picked the simplest option.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya tugs her by the hand toward the ghost, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re gonna stay and keep you company.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; the ghost questions.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;If we stay here, your friend may be able to find us, and we can wait with you to make sure you&rsquo;re okay,&rdquo; Katya explains, the ghost floating closer to the ground and becoming more still as she calms down.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>They all sit down on a fallen log conveniently laying next to them.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; Katya asks the ghost, making conversation. She&rsquo;ll be best friends with her in no time.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Eleanor,&rdquo; the ghost responds simply.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Nice to meet you Eleanor!&rdquo; Katya exclaims, &ldquo;are you from around here?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya and Eleanor make conversation easily, the ghost calming down more and more, her form becoming more stable and solid as she becomes more comfortable in their presence. Trixie smiles as she watches them, in awe of the way Katya is always able to make people comfortable.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful night out, the sky is clear, stars poking through the gaps in the trees above them, and there&rsquo;s a gentle breeze. The darkness is chilly though, and the breeze sends a shiver through Trixie.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya feels her shiver, &ldquo;we should make a fire,&rdquo; she suggests, standing up already to collect materials.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;How are we gonna do that?&rdquo; Trixie asks. <br /><br />&ldquo;I got this,&rdquo; Katya responds confidently.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie isn&rsquo;t so sure, but she lets Katya do her thing, there&rsquo;s no use in trying to stop her. Katya walks around the perimeter of their little area, collecting dry leaves and sticks. She clears a large circle of the ground, brushing any leaves and plants from the area and makes a little pile, starting with the leaves and weighing them down with the sticks. She finds some bigger chunks of wood, large branches that have fallen out of the trees and stacks them carefully on top of the pile she made.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; she says, standing proudly over her creation.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;How do we light it?&rdquo; Trixie asks.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya reaches into her pocket, taking out a lighter and holding it up triumphantly.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Fucking disgusting smoker,&rdquo; Trixie mutters.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky I&rsquo;m a disgusting smoker, mama, I&rsquo;m about to save you from freezing your ass off.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya crouches down and holds the lighter to the leaves, lighting them ablaze. She lights a few of them around the fire and quickly the twigs start catching on fire too, spreading until the entire pile is lit up, providing a warm glow and a pleasant heat.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya smirks at Trixie as she struts back to the log, sitting down next to her girlfriend again. Trixie rolls her eyes. Eleanor has remained silent, amusedly watching the two of them banter.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>They sit quietly for a while, getting lost in the way the flames dance around the fire, and taking in the beautiful night. The warmth and the late hour are making them sleepy, and Trixie and Katya start to drift off into a peaceful sleep.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The next time their eyes open it&rsquo;s light out, the sun has risen and the birds are chirping loudly. The fire has died down completely, a few smoldering embers left behind in a pile of ash. Katya slowly blinks awake, confused by her surroundings until she remembers the night before. She shoots awake, sitting upright and looking around.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Eleanor?&rdquo; she questions, not seeing the ghost anywhere. <br /><br />Trixie wakes up when she hears her, groggy with sleep.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; Katya tells her when she sees Trixie&rsquo;s questioning look.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Who is?&rdquo; Trixie asks, voice thick with sleep.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Eleanor,&rdquo; Katya says again, &ldquo;the ghost.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie wakes up a little more, remembering the night before, and she sits up too.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Was that real?&rdquo; Trixie asks. There&rsquo;s no evidence of the ghost, they didn&rsquo;t see what happened to her, where she went, and the memory is already starting to fade.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It felt real,&rdquo; Katya responds. She looks distraught, unhappy with the loose ending to this story.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Eventually they get up, finding their way out of the woods and back home where they can sleep in a real bed. This becomes a distant memory, a story they talk about from time to time, never sure if it actually happened or if it was merely a dream.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; Katya says calmly, approaching the ghost carefully, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a ghost.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;No I&rsquo;m not!&rdquo; the ghost yells, her voice booming loudly through their chests and the depths of the woods.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Katya says, &ldquo;but you are, but we can help you!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Stop saying that!&rdquo; the ghost yells, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a ghost! I&rsquo;m not! I&rsquo;m just lost!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The ghost is growing more distraught by the second, her translucent body becoming foggy and blurry as if it&rsquo;s vibrating quickly.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We can help,&rdquo; Katya tries again, the ghost interrupting her to let out a piercing yell.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>It rings in their ears, and the leaves on the trees around them start rustling. They close their eyes, hands over their ears to try to block out the noise that seems to be seeping into their skin. When the noise has stopped and they open their eyes, the ghost is gone. All that&rsquo;s left is a slight breeze and a cloud of mist that&rsquo;s being carried away by the wind.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; Katya says, sounding disappointed, &ldquo;I scared her away.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie moves closer to her, wrapping an arm around her, &ldquo;you were just trying to help,&rdquo; she comforts her, &ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t know she would react like that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya nods, staying quiet.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; Trixie prompts her, moving her arm from around Katya&rsquo;s body and taking her hand, interlacing their fingers, &ldquo;maybe we can find her again.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya nods again, letting Trixie lead her by the hand. Trixie starts walking and in just seconds she realizes that she has no idea where they are. The woods look completely unfamiliar and she doesn&rsquo;t know how to get back to their car.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Kat,&rdquo; she says quietly.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Hm,&rdquo; Katya hums in response.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Do you know how to get out of here?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; Katya looks around, &ldquo;I think this way?&rdquo; she points to their left.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>They start walking in that direction but the woods don&rsquo;t change, everything is still unfamiliar, dense trees that all look the same and an endless darkness stretching out in front of them.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>They walk for what feels like miles, it feels like they&rsquo;re going in circles, their surroundings looking the same over and over like they&rsquo;re on a treadmill. The sun has started to come up and Trixie is exhausted, Katya is silent beside her, ruminating in her guilt. Birds start chirping and finally, with more light, Trixie can see the edge of the woods, their car shining in the early morning light. They make it to the car and climb in, Trixie taking the driver&rsquo;s seat this time. They slouch over in their seats, tired from all of the walking, and a mix of feelings bubbling in their chests.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just watch for a minute,&rdquo; Trixie suggests, wanting to make sure that this is safe before they take it any further.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya nods in agreement and they stand there observing. The ghost continues pacing the entire time and upon closer inspection, they appear to be gliding, their legs are not moving in a walking motion but rather floating gently off the ground. The light emanating from their body remains constant, not changing color or brightness outside of the soft pulsing that remains steady.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>It feels quieter here than it did in the rest of the woods, the ambient noises completely drowned out by the bubble that they are seemingly in with this ghost. It&rsquo;s so silent that the soft sounds of the being starting to cry are deafening.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The ghost stops pacing, back hunching over as they rest their head in their hands, light pulsing faster in time with the sobs that they&rsquo;re releasing.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Is it...crying?&rdquo; Trixie asks, confirming that what she&rsquo;s seeing is accurate.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; Katya responds, &ldquo;we need to help her.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; Trixie asks.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We need to make sure she&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; Katya says, turning back to look at the ghost, unable to not be sympathetic toward the form that&rsquo;s folded in on itself, sobbing now.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Katya calls out, trying to get the ghost&rsquo;s attention.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The ghost stops crying, whipping around at superhuman speed to face them, shining bright white and face full of fear. The ghost flies quickly at them, it appears like she grows bigger the closer she gets, flying right up to their faces so their entire field of vision is only made up of her. With a bright white light that burns their eyes the ghost disappears, puffing away in a cloud of mist.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya stands in shock, &ldquo;that did not go how I expected it to.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We should&rsquo;ve known you would be scarier than any ghost, with your old, grey skin,&rdquo; Trixie jokes.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya wheezes and Trixie is glad she doesn&rsquo;t seem too upset that she just ruined her chance of meeting a ghost.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not upset?&rdquo; Trixie asks.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;A little,&rdquo; Katya says, &ldquo;but Trixie we just saw a ghost!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Yeah we did,&rdquo; Trixie responds, it didn&rsquo;t really hit her until then. She&rsquo;s spent so long making fun of Katya for believing in ghosts but this whole time she&rsquo;s been right.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya smiles at her, taking her hand again and swinging it happily between them as she leads them out of the woods.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; Katya whispers, walking toward the ghost slowly.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>They&rsquo;re treading carefully, but a stick breaks under Katya&rsquo;s foot, cracking loudly and alerting the ghost of their presence. The ghost whips around, the glow brightening until it hurts to look at and the air seems to grow colder.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The ghost seems shocked to see other people, staring wide eyed at them for some time.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; the ghost asks, fear in their voice.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; Katya says, hand stretched out to placate the ghost and to block the nearly blinding light, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Katya,&rdquo; she says before she points to Trixie, &ldquo;and this is Trixie.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; the ghost asks, the light has died down only slightly, enough for Katya to lower her hand, but she&rsquo;s still defensive.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We were just taking a walk,&rdquo; Katya says, it&rsquo;s sort of the truth, &ldquo;what are you doing here?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; the ghost starts, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo; The light flares up again, the ghost looking distraught, the light is pulsing faster this time.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie and Katya look at each other, unsure of how to proceed from here.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>They choose to wait silently, not sure how to proceed.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The ghost remains staring at them, unblinking, the only sign that they&rsquo;re not a statue is the gentle up and down movement of their floating form.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem like the ghost is going to start talking any time soon and Trixie is growing impatient. They&rsquo;ve been standing here in silence for about twenty minutes and it&rsquo;s felt like hours, and the unblinking eyes staring them down are starting to become deeply unsettling.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Are you lost?&rdquo; Katya asks, she&rsquo;s slowly moving closer to the ghost, leaving Trixie behind her to try and comfort the ghost as best as she can.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; the ghost responds, sounding out of it before she snaps her head up to look at Katya, looking more sure now, &ldquo;yes, I&rsquo;m lost, I was with my friend, but then we got separated and now I can&rsquo;t find her,&rdquo; she explains.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Okay, do you need some help?&rdquo; Katya asks, more than willing to offer help at the drop of a hat, even for a ghost.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t know what to do,&rdquo; the ghost starts to panic, lighting up bright again, and returning to pacing back and forth, quicker this time.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie moves up to where Katya is standing, taking her hand again.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;What do we do?&rdquo; she asks Katya, trying to stay calm.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We need to help her,&rdquo; Katya responds easily.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;How do we do that?&rdquo; Trixie asks, not sure how to proceed with helping a panicking ghost looking for a lost friend that may or may not be alive.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Trixie and Katya head out of the woods, choosing to go home instead. They climb into the car, Trixie relieved to no longer be wandering around in the dark scared out of her mind. Katya is quiet though, she looks disappointed.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry we had to leave,&rdquo; Trixie says softly, putting her hand on Katya&rsquo;s leg comfortingly.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya turns the key to start the car, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s okay, thanks for coming with me I know you didn&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; she says genuinely, forcing a smile at Trixie.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie smiles back, leaning over to kiss Katya on the cheek before buckling her seatbelt.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya pulls out of the parking lot and onto the road, starting the drive back to their house. The car is uncharacteristically quiet and Trixie feels guilty that she made them leave when Katya wanted this so badly. She was so scared though, she didn&rsquo;t think she would make it much longer out there. After a long, silent ride, Katya pulls into their driveway and cuts the engine, climbing out, leaving her backpack behind.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie trails after her, waiting patiently behind her and Katya unlocks the door and lets them into the house. Trixie locks the door behind them and turns to Katya who is taking off her shoes by the door.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Do you want to watch a movie?&rdquo; she asks, trying to salvage the evening and cheer her girlfriend up.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Katya responds, &ldquo;ooo can we watch Poltergeist?&rdquo; she asks, her voice more enthusiastic at the thought of the movie.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Trixie smiles, relieved that Katya is already shaking her disappointment, &ldquo;sure baby,&rdquo; she agrees.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Katya smiles at her, leaning in and leaving a loud smacking kiss on her lips before running off calling, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m making popcorn!&rdquo; over her shoulder.&nbsp;</p>
